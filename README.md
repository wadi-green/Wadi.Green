The aim is to educate everyone how to live an eco-friendly life via a plateform that is for the people, by the people.

🌏 This is the public repository for the landing page hosted at https://www.wadi.green

📱 To view the mobile app, go to the repository [Skanking Tiger](https://github.com/wadi-green/skanking_tiger) 🐅

# Want to contribute ?

### Current state

The entire infrastructure is built and managed by [me](https://github.com/MSaifAsif) in my free time. I can use all the help I can get in maintaining this plateform.

### How to help

#### As a developer or designer ? 
I beleive in transparency. The entire app code base can be found at [Skanking Tiger](https://github.com/wadi-green/skanking_tiger) and I have also created some [Projects](https://github.com/wadi-green/Wadi.Green/projects) to organize tasks. I try to keep things organized in a kanban board style, if you see something you can help out with or if you have some new ideas, reach out.

#### Do you love to teach and write?

All the `Activities` in the system is content created by a variety of people from all across the world, 21 to be precise, from 5 different countries. The more `Activities` we create, the better it is for people. Help me in finding new ones, proof-reading and managing them.
