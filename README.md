# Wadi.green

The aim is to educate everyone how to live an eco-friendly life via a plateform that is for the people, by the people.

# What defines us ?

- An easy to use plateform for searching `Activities` related to sustainability topics
- Helping people learn how they can adopt a more eco-friendly lifestyle by following easy to do steps
- Encouraging people from around the world to teach others about awesome ways on how to do so

# What we are not

- An e-commerce service to market merchandise
- Just another social networking plateform

# Want to contribute ?

### Current state

The entire infrastructure is built and managed by [me](https://github.com/MSaifAsif) in my free time. I can use all the help I can get in maintaining this plateform.

### How to help

#### As a developer or designer ? 
I beleive in transparency. The entire app code base can be found [here](...) and I have also created some [Projects](...) to organize tasks. I try to keep things organized in a kanban board style, if you see something you can help out with in your free time, reach out ! 

#### Do you love to teach and write?

All the `Activities` in the system is content created by a variety of people from all across the world (I count close to 21 contributors). The more `Activities` we create, the better it is for people. Help me find, proof-read and create new `Activities`.
