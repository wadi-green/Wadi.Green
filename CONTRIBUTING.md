# As a developer or designer ? 
I beleive in transparency. The entire app code base can be found at [Skanking Tiger](https://github.com/wadi-green/skanking_tiger) and I have also created some [Projects](https://github.com/wadi-green/Wadi.Green/projects) to organize tasks. I try to keep things organized in a kanban board style, 
if you see something you can help out with or if you have some new ideas, reach out.

# Do you love to teach and write?

All the `Activities` in the system is content created by a variety of people from all across the world, 21 to be precise, from 5 different countries. 
The more `Activities` we create, the better it is for people. Help me in finding new ones, proof-reading and managing them.
